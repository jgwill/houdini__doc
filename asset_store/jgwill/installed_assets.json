The relative size of these meshes are often HUGE....so\ngiant that you have to zoom out to see it.\n\nTwo things to try:\nSelect the terrain node in the network view. then  move your mouse over\nthe  main 3d viewport and hit  space-g. This will home the view to what\never is selected.\n\nOr you could  just scale the whole terrain to .1 and see if it's visible.\n\nIf that doesn't do it, then go to the heightmap image pulldown menu and\nselect one of the default images.\n\nIf you have used a custom image, then check the following:\nIf you are using a standard jpeg, you should be plugging it in under the\n8-bit pulldown.\nIf you have an HDR,EXR, tiff16 or tiff 32 then use the pulldown under the\n16-32 bit image area.\n\n\nAlso, if your  custom image has all values which are ALL  slightly higher\nthat 0,0,0 (total black)\nThen your terrain will be slightly higher than you might  expect...maybe\nseveral hundred meters!\n","created_utc_timestamp":1343069960,"type":"asset","creator":"SideFX","version_sequence_number":8,"node_type_name":"SideFX::heightmapterraingenerator","num_votes":1,"otl_dependents":[
